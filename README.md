## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting future sales for Rossmann stores using machine learning techniques. The objective is to create a robust predictive model capable of estimating sales based on various factors, such as store characteristics, promotional activities, and seasonal variations. This analysis can help the company optimize inventory, staffing, and marketing strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project is the **Rossmann Store Sales** dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data). The dataset includes:
- Historical sales data for multiple Rossmann stores.
- Features such as store type, promotional status, and holiday information.
- Additional variables like store size and location.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies and libraries were employed in this project:
- **Python**: The programming language used for data analysis and model development.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array handling.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced statistical data visualization.

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sales-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning.git
